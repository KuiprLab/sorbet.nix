# Gatus — synthetic monitoring with Discord alerts.
# Two instances: one on sorbet, one on eclair, cross-probing each other.
#
# Cross-probe topology:
#   sorbet gatus:
#     - LAN/internal services (caddy, navidrome, etc.) on *.int.kuipr.de
#     - Auto-generated *.ext.kuipr.de checks via public DNS → eclair → tailnet
#     - eclair host ICMP + TCP/443
#   eclair gatus:
#     - sorbet caddy via tailnet (tests sorbet from eclair's POV)
#     - ext domains via own loopback haproxy (black-box test of the VPS path)
#     - haproxy stats backend health (catches backend-down even when 443 up)
#
# If sorbet's ISP/host dies, eclair gatus still alerts.
# If eclair dies, sorbet gatus still alerts (and ext checks naturally fail).
